**Beat Saber multiplayer mod that adds a Server Browser to the Online menu, making it easy to share and join multiplayer games.**

### Joining games
Open the Online menu, then click on the "Server Browser" button. From there, you'll see all public multiplayer games. Click on a game, and then select "Connect" to jump right in.

### Sharing games
When creating a server, you'll see the option to add it to the Server Browser. You can also set a custom name for the game if you want.

If you're the party leader or lobby owner, you can control these settings from the Gameplay Modifiers panel as well. This is located on the left side of the lobby.

**If you share your game on the Server Browser, anyone will be able to join! Your server code will be publicly visible on the site (https://bssb.app) as well.**

### Custom songs
If you want to use custom songs, you'll need the following mods as well:

- **MultiplayerCore**: Lets you choose custom songs in multiplayer lobbies, and will download any missing songs from BeatSaver automatically.
- **BeatTogether**: Provides custom dedicated servers that allow modded content.
 
Be sure to check if these mods are available for your game version, and grab them if you can.

âš  **Important:** If you are the host, you have to create the lobby on BeatTogether servers. Official Servers DO NOT allow custom songs. Make sure BeatTogether is selected in the Online menu (mode selection).

### Cross-play
Beat Saber has enabled cross-play for all platforms on official servers. Unofficial servers like BeatTogether always allow cross play. You'll encounter both Steam and Oculus players when you play.

Please note that different versions of Beat Saber, MultiplayerCore, etc., may not be compatible. Make sure everyone is on the same game version for the best experience.
